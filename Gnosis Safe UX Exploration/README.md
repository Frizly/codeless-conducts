# Gnosis Safe - UX Exploration
Possibilities are endless.
Crypto is just starting to create the infrastructure for real freedom. But it is far from reaching out to everyone in the world.
First, for its tech complexity. Handling digital wallets it’s hard enough for non-tech people, let alone trying to use a safe with multi-sig.
Then, the infrastructure to connect to the “real” world is taking baby steps. How long before my local flower shop or my favorite cafe can take my crypto?
And third but not least, there is a big portion of the world that lacks accessible connectivity and electrical power before even considering getting into the space, where the development of their businesses would be easier than in the traditional banking systems.
Well, we are not superheroes, and we can not solve all problems at the same time. But we like to begin with setting things into perspective, to dream in the long term while taking care of the short term.

## Motivation
We want to make it accessible and easy for people to join crypto. Why, but because of multiple benefits we relate to freedom: no one but me is responsible for managing my assets. No one can refrain me from using them. No one can take them away. No one can take away fees for “helping” me handle them. No one becomes rich at our expense. We love how Gnosis safely lets us accomplish that.

## Use cases we can think of
-	Extra security for the same person. In case of lost seed phrase/devices, you can still access funds from a second or third device.
-	Teaching kids in highschool to manage their assets, with permission from the teacher
-	Manage assets as a family (NFT property deeds)
-	Handling IP licenses, as an agency for artists and creators
-	Being an organization, like a DAO, but not a technical one, maybe a discord one, that wants to handle assets by founders.
-	An established, traditional organization, getting into crypto

## Our journey with Gnosis Safe
As a team, we used Gnosis safe to transfer an NFT from our safe to an outside account. During this process we also used Wallet Connect to sign-in with Gnosis Safe. 
It’s a fairly simple process if you already have a wallet set up. It might take only a few minutes to create.

</p>
From the app, choose to create a new Safe. A Safe is pretty much like a digital wallet, but with special conditions.

</p>
It will provide you a new address, but this one only works in the specific chain where it is intended to be used. There is not yet a multi Chain Safe, so choose wisely. I use Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai) as fees are close to zero.

Depending on the chain you are in, it will support different wallets. I used Frame in these examples. Here you must confirm what Chain you wish to create your Safe.

</p>
Then pick an awesome and useful name for it. It could be anything. But you can change it later, so no worries. Actually, all these names and tags are not directly stored in your safe. The name is locally stored in your computer  as reference, but whenever you open your Safe again somewhere else, you could rename it the same or different.

**Note: Here is where we can add other addresses as owners. Later on you can add more addresses so you share ownership of the safe and the assets inside. You will need some native currency in your wallet for the gas of this transaction.**

Here I am ready to create the Safe. That is a transaction I need to sign with my wallet.

Ta-da! This is how you get your new safe

This is a very very important warning to take into account. But it doesn’t show how important it is. This should be a striking message for a begginer, just imagine losing a very important amount of money or NFT! The consequences are horrible.

**We can only use this address on the Gnosis Chain "gno:0x6694779a905F15Af703723AC9182c6E0379eC7Ae".
Sending funds from other chains or toward other chains to this address will result in lost assets.**

It's a beautiful place where we'll be able to keep track of all our assets.

Done. That's it, now whenever we wan't to transfer this NFT, both owners need to sign the transaction.

## UX Conclusion
Gnosis Safe adds a layer of protection, but also of complexity that we wish to fight in this bounty.
It makes me feel safe that my assets, even shared assets, are going to be there no matter what.
But it makes me nervous in the process of doing transactions. I fear something is not going as planned, that I am screwing up.
And sometimes I dread using it because of how time-consuming it is compared to just using a0 wallet.

-	Share / export name of accounts for organizations
-	Tooltip information to show that the process is ongoing, they just have to wait for the chain to confirm.
-	Tooltip on transaction and inactive buttons, what needs to be done in order to use it
